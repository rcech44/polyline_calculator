# Polyline calculator and renderer

Application that calculates the length of polylines defined by multiple points with [x,y] coords. It also tries to render all points in the console using cartesian coordinate system.
At the end it shows polyline length:
```
...
46      =      4,      -16
47      =      -27,    -1
48      =      24,     -3
-----------------------------------
Number of points: 48
Polyline length: 1856.671331
```
